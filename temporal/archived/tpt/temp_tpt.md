### **Core Idea**

Temporal persistence (TPT) is a **post-detection filtering method**. Instead of relying only on a single frame’s YOLO detection, it looks across **multiple consecutive frames (a sliding window)** and only accepts detections if they appear *persistently enough* within that window.

---

### **Step-by-Step in Your Code**

1. **Initialize temporal buffer**

   ```python
   temporal_buffer = np.zeros((window_size))
   pos = 0
   ```

   * `temporal_buffer`: a circular buffer (length = `window_size`) storing whether an object was detected (`True/1`) or not (`False/0`) in each frame.
   * `pos`: pointer to the current index in the buffer (like a sliding window).

---

2. **Each frame: record detection presence**

   ```python
   temporal_buffer[pos] = True
   pos = (pos + 1) % window_size
   ```

   * When YOLO detects something in the current frame, mark this position in the buffer as `True`.
   * `pos` moves forward, wrapping around (circular buffer).

---

3. **Apply persistence threshold**

   ```python
   if np.sum(temporal_buffer) <= (threshold * window_size):
       mask[:] = False
       det = det[mask]
   ```

   * `np.sum(temporal_buffer)` = number of frames in the window where detection occurred.
   * Compare with **persistence threshold**:

     * Example: `threshold = 0.5` and `window_size = 20` → need at least **10 detections in last 20 frames**.
   * If detections don’t persist enough → **suppress all detections in the current frame**.

---

### **Effect**

* Removes **spurious / one-off false positives** (e.g., fire-like colors in just 1 frame).
* Keeps **real, persistent objects** that appear across multiple frames.

---

### **Example**

* Parameters: `window_size=20`, `persistence_thresh=0.5`
* Condition: At least **10/20 frames must have detections** for a detection to be considered valid.

| Frame | Detection? | Buffer (last 5 shown) | Sum | Decision |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------------- | --- | -------- |
| 1     | Yes        | \[1,0,0,0,0]          | 1   | Suppress |
| 2     | Yes        | \[1,1,0,0,0]          | 2   | Suppress |
| ...   | ...        | ...                   | ... | ...      |
| 10    | Yes        | \[1,1,1,1,1]          | 10  | Keep     |
| 11    | Yes        | \[1,1,1,1,1]          | 11  | Keep     |

So only after persistence builds up, detections pass through.

---

✅ **Summary**:
TPT works like a **debouncer for object detections** — it requires an object to be detected in enough proportion of recent frames (set by `persistence_thresh`) before confirming it, thus filtering out short-lived false positives.

Do you want me to also **compare TPT vs tracker** in your code, so you clearly see when one is better than the other?
